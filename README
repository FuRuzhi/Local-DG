# Local-DG
Local Discontinuous Galerkin Solver written in C++ and MPI for use on supercomputers such as NERSC's Edison or TACC's Stampede to solve problems involving the Navier-Stokes equations in 3D.

Can be compiled using the MPI Intel compiler (`mpiicpc`) or MPI GCC compiler (`mpic++`).

To install, run `git clone https://github.com/NoseKnowsAll/Navier-Stokes.git`

## Running the Program

Main options that can be changed are available in `driver.cpp` and in the constructor `Solver::Solver()` within `solver.cpp`.

First compile the program:

1) On Edison:
* Ensure `CC` defined as `mpiicpc` in Makefile
* `source init.sh`
* `make`

2) On Stampede:
* Ensure `CC` defined as `mpiicpc` in Makefile
* `make`

3) On Implicit:
* Ensure `CC` defined as `mpic++` in Makefile
* `make`

Once code is successfully compiled, run executable with `./driver`
